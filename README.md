Idea: We are building an application that pulls information on tides and weather at an indicated beach to determine if it is a good day to go enjoy the area.

Target Audience: Clam Diggers, beach combers, kayakers, boaters  

Problem: Our problem is that tide tables are complex and provide a lot of information.  We want to give casual beach goers only the information they need, quickly and easily.  

Goal: Our goal is to provide tide and weather data in a user-friendly way  

User Stories: As a user, I am able to search for a beach and view tide and weather data for the upcoming week.  

Nice to Haves: Information on harmful algal booms, Social Media sharing options, User pictures
